# Codex Account Switcher

Codex++ tweak for saving, switching, and managing Codex desktop auth sessions.

## Features

- Automatically saves the active Codex auth session when it does not match a saved account.
- Shows saved accounts by email when an email is available in the auth token.
- Adds a compact collapsible Accounts section to Codex's account popup, anchored above Rate limits remaining.
- Switches accounts directly from the account popup. Switching replaces the active auth file and relaunches Codex.
- Shows cached 5-hour and weekly rate-limit remaining values for accounts that have been active, including the reset time when a window is exhausted.
- Adds a dedicated Accounts settings page for setup, refresh, switching, deletion, and new sign-in flows.
- Starts a new sign-in by backing up and clearing the active auth file, then relaunching Codex.

## Storage

- active auth: `~/.codex/auth.json`
- saved accounts: `~/.codex/auth_accounts/<name>.json`
- current account marker: `~/.codex/current_account`
- cached rate-limit usage: `~/.codex/auth_accounts_usage.json`

New sign-in backups are written as `~/.codex/auth.account-switcher-backup-<timestamp>.json`.
